## Course Description from [College Catalog](https://arc.losrios.edu/2022-2023-catalog)
This course applies object-oriented techniques for systematic problem analysis and the managing of program complexity using abstraction. Specification, design, coding, testing, and documentation of large multifile programs are covered. It uses advanced language features such as classes, strings, non-text files, pointers, and recursion. Abstract data types such as stacks, queues, lists, binary trees, heaps/priority queues, hash tables, and graphs are examined. Various sorting and searching algorithms are presented and analyzed using Big-O notation.
